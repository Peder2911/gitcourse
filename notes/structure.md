# Structure

The course should aim to cover enough of git to allow people to use it. Deeper understanding of git can be gained from following the tips under "further reading". There is lots of great, open learning material related to using git, both in a technical and in a practical sense.

The course is structured like this:

## Component -1: Command line social science?

This very short component quickly gives an introduction to the command line. 

## Component 0: Introduction

This component motivates the participant by explaining what git is, and why it is useful.

## Component 1: Technical

This component is a shallow introduction, giving the participant basic knowledge about how git works. The component is focused on a set of commands, which can be described as the "git essentials" kit which are absolutely necessary for using git. These are:

* `git init`

"What is going on / what did i do?"
* `git status`
* `git diff`

"Managing files, committing"
* `git add`
* `git rm`
* `git commit`

"I did something wrong"
* `git reset`
* `git reset --hard`

"What is going on 2"
* `git log`

"Remote things"
* `git clone`
* `git push`
* `git pull

"Branching, navigating the tree"
* `git branch`
* `git checkout`

"Who did what"
* `git blame [file]`

## Component 2: Practical

This component focuses on the art of using git, with a focus on collaboration. Using the basic skills attained in the previous component, participants should be able to follow along.
This component is about the organizational aspects of using git, rather than technical aspects (examples are show in the browser).

* Collaboration
