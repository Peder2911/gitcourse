Just notes from different sources. 


An important point i really need to emphasize is that git is a lot larger than
most people need to be aware of. Knowing just the basics is more than enough
for working effectively with git.

Committing saves progress, which makes it important to commit before doing anything potentially destructive. Committing is key to stress-free git.

Want numerous tamper-proof geographically diverse redundant archives? If your project has many developers, don’t do anything! Every clone of your code is effectively a backup. Not just of the current state, but of your project’s entire history. Thanks to cryptographic hashing, if anyone’s clone becomes corrupted, it will be spotted as soon as they try to communicate with others.

Instant branching and merging are the most lethal of Git’s killer features.

## Could cover?

Should maybe talk about tagging commits in connection to navigating histories / trees. Also, something about semver, tagging versions.
