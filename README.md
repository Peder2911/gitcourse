# "Git good"

A short and concise `git` course meant for academics. This course
was written to help the team at ViEWS maintain their codebase.

The course is opinionated when it comes to best practices, in order
not to complicate things too much. Feedback is welcome!

Very much a WIP at this point (2020-07-09)
